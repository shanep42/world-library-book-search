## Description:

This is a simple search engine interfacing with a Google book search API to allow the user to search for books and save their favorites using MongoDB to save users and their saved books.

It was originally using a RESTful API before I modified it to use Apollo Server for GraphQL. This should in theory allow it to more easily handle larger amounts of data and customize queries and mutations for any future development.


### Installation

To run the client and server locally, get the code at the [Github Repo](https://github.com/shanep42/world-library-book-search), then use 
```
npm run develop
```
from the root directory (where you should find this README!)

### Usage
The app is most easily used online in its Heroku Deployment, [here](https://protected-springs-18395.herokuapp.com).
You can search right away, but saving and removing your saved books will naturally require you to log in.
